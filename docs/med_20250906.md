### Abstract

We propose **Metaphase Evolutionary Development (MED)**, a concise development paradigm for the LLM era that institutionalizes a loop of **mass generation → automated evaluation and selection → evolutionary integration**. MED reframes software creation as a population-based search over candidate designs and implementations, where artifacts and lessons from each cycle are **distilled into reusable assets** (tests, schemas, prompts, policies) and **re-injected** as priors for the next *metaphase*. MED operationalizes “**FUTURE beyond FAIR**” (FAIR-based, User-first, Transparent, Unified, Reproducible, Evolvable) by coupling offline correctness with online causal validation and by allocating scarce compute/traffic using multi-fidelity early stopping and bandit methods. We position MED relative to large-batch code generation, deliberate inference (Self-Consistency, Tree-of-Thoughts), trustworthy online experimentation, multi-armed bandits, Hyperband/ASHA, and multi-objective evolutionary selection (NSGA-II).

### 1. Introduction

Agile and DevOps have shortened feedback loops, yet they rarely **convert experience into structured priors** that guide the next development round. Meanwhile, evidence from **large-batch code generation with behavioral filtering** shows that “generate many, select a few” can solve non-trivial programming tasks \[1]. In reasoning tasks, **diversified sampling** and **structured search** (e.g., Self-Consistency, Tree-of-Thoughts) improve reliability by exploring multiple inference paths before committing to an answer \[2,3].

We therefore **propose MED** as a new software development method: a population-based process that (i) distills assets from prior work; (ii) **generates** diverse candidates in parallel; (iii) **evaluates and selects** them via offline tests and online experiments; and (iv) **integrates** the elites while feeding distilled knowledge back as priors for the next metaphase. MED’s goal is to make “generate–select–integrate” a **first-class, auditable** process that realizes the FUTURE beyond FAIR principles in practice.

### 2. Method: The MED Loop

**Distill.** From each cycle, extract reusable assets—unit/property/E2E tests, acceptance criteria, I/O schemas, performance baselines, license/security guards, curated prompts/toolchains—forming a **knowledge base (KB)** that seeds the next round.

**Generate (Parallel Batch Implementation).** Produce W diverse candidates (W≈10–100, budget-dependent) by varying models, prompts, tools, and stochasticity (temperature/seed). Employ **multi-fidelity early stopping** to prune weak candidates quickly, following **Hyperband** and **ASHA** \[5,6].

**Evaluate & Select.**

* *Offline correctness.* Run tests, static analysis (security/SBOM/license), differential regression, and perf/cost profiling. Because fitness is vector-valued, select a **Pareto front** using **NSGA-II** to avoid metric gaming and preserve trade-offs \[7].
* *Online impact.* For user-facing changes, conduct **trustworthy online controlled experiments** with a pre-declared **Overall Evaluation Criterion (OEC)**; when variants are many or traffic scarce, use **multi-armed bandits** (e.g., UCB1) to adaptively allocate traffic before confirmatory A/B \[4,10].

**Integrate (Evolutionary Integration).** Merge selected candidates through a policy gate (diff + review + policy checks). Practice **elitism** by registering the best artifacts—and their tests/prompts/policies—back into the KB, seeding the **next metaphase**, analogous to **Population-Based Training** and **Regularized Evolution** in population optimization \[8,9].

### 3. Operationalization and Governance

**Diversity operators.** Treat diversity as a resource: model families, prompt frames, tool stacks, planning strategies (flat CoT vs. tree search), and sampling seeds. Lightweight **best-of-N** via Self-Consistency can pre-filter candidates before expensive execution \[2].

**Resource allocation.** Combine **Hyperband/ASHA** with **bandits** to balance breadth and depth under fixed budgets \[4–6].

**FUTURE beyond FAIR mapping.**

* **FAIR-based:** Machine-readable assets (schemas, runners) enable findability and reuse across metaphases.
* **User-first:** OEC encodes user value; multi-objective selection prevents regressions masked by single metrics.
* **Transparent & Reproducible:** Log versions, seeds, prompts, tools, costs, and decisions for audit and replay.
* **Unified:** Single registry for prompts/tools/tests/policies reduces drift between design and implementation.
* **Evolvable:** Distilled elites become priors for the next metaphase, enabling self-improving development.

### 4. Related Work and Positioning

MED integrates results from **competition-level code generation** \[1], **deliberate inference** \[2,3], **multi-armed bandits** \[4], **multi-fidelity HPO** (Hyperband/ASHA) \[5,6], **multi-objective evolutionary selection** (NSGA-II) \[7], and **population-based optimization** (PBT; regularized evolution) \[8,9], while grounding online decisions in **trustworthy experimentation** with **OEC** \[10]. MED’s novelty lies in elevating these components into a **coherent, process-level method** that is asset-centric and metaphase-driven.

### 5. Conclusion

MED proposes a compact, auditable paradigm for LLM-era software: **generate many, select wisely, integrate evolutionarily**, and recycle elites as priors. By unifying offline correctness with online causal validation and by allocating budgets via early stopping and bandits, MED offers a practical path to **faster, safer, and more adaptive** development aligned with **FUTURE beyond FAIR**.
